## School Library Web Application

### Description

This project is a comprehensive web application designed to manage a school library's operations. It is built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, with MySQL as the database. The application allows users to manage books, handle user registrations, track book loans, and generate various reports. The system ensures that library staff can efficiently handle inventory, track user activities, and maintain records of book transactions.

### Features

- **User Management**: Allows registration and management of library members, including students and staff.
- **Book Management**: Facilitates adding, updating, and tracking books in the library.
- **Loan Management**: Manages the borrowing and returning of books, including due dates and overdue penalties.
- **Reservation System**: Enables users to reserve books that are currently checked out.
- **Reporting**: Generates reports on book usage, member activity, and inventory status.
- **User Roles**: Differentiates between user roles such as administrators, agents, and members with specific permissions.

### Database Connection

The connection to the MySQL database is established using PHP. Below is an example of how the connection is made in the `config.php` file:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "library_db";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>

```

This code initializes the connection to the MySQL database using the server name, username, password, and database name. If the connection fails, an error message is displayed.
